 * Scaffold cost scales mainly with how many elevations need wrapping, not
 * with how "detached" a property feels. A standalone house is exposed on
 * all four sides; terraced houses share party walls with both neighbours
 * and typically only need scaffolding on two. Semi-detached sits between
 * (one shared wall); flats often mean complex or communal access.
 * Cross-checked against published scaffold-cost ranges: a typical semi
 * runs £900–£1,800, a detached (or anything needing a full wrap) £1,500–
 * £3,500 — detached trends higher despite easier site access, because the
 * extra elevations outweigh it (MyBuilder / MyJobQuote 2026 scaffolding
 * cost guides).
